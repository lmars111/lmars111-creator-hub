## Test Steps

2. **Verify Overview tab**:
   - Check earnings summary displays correctly
   - Verify unlock history shows recent events
3. **Test Content CRUD**:

   - Edit existing content
   - Delete content (with confirmation)
   - Verify all operations update the list
4. **Test AI Persona configuration**:

- Content operations are scoped to the authenticated creator
- Form validation prevents invalid data submission
- Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental deletions

## Technical Implementation

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js App Router with API routes
- **Data**: In-memory storage for demo purposes
- **Authentication**: Demo session logic (production would use real auth)
- **State Management**: React useState and useEffect hooks
