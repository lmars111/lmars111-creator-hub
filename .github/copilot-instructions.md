# lmars111-creator-hub

The lmars111-creator-hub is currently a minimal repository containing only a README.md file. This is a new/empty repository that serves as a foundation for future creator hub development.

Always reference these instructions first and fallback to search or bash commands only when you encounter unexpected information that does not match the info here.

## Working Effectively

### Repository Structure
- Repository contains only a README.md file at the root level
- No build system, dependencies, or application code currently exists
- No package.json, Makefile, or other build configuration files present
- Repository is in early development stage

### Basic Operations
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/lmars111/lmars111-creator-hub.git`
- Check repository status: `git status`
- View current files: `ls -la` (will show only README.md and .git directory)
- Current working branch varies - check with: `git branch`

### Git Operations
- Always check current branch before making changes: `git branch`
- Create new feature branches: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
- Stage changes: `git add .`
- Commit changes: `git commit -m "Your commit message"`
- Push changes: `git push origin your-branch-name`

## Build and Test Instructions

### Current State
- **No build system exists** - there are no build commands to run
- **No test suite exists** - there are no tests to execute
- **No dependencies** - no package.json, requirements.txt, or similar dependency files
- **No compilation required** - repository contains only documentation

### Validation Steps
Since no build system exists, validation consists of:
- Verify git operations work correctly
- Ensure any new files follow repository conventions
- Check that README.md remains valid markdown
- Validate any new documentation is properly formatted

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Content
When adding new code or features to this repository:
- Create appropriate project structure (package.json for Node.js, requirements.txt for Python, etc.)
- Add build scripts and configuration files as needed
- Create test directories and basic test infrastructure
- Update these instructions to reflect new build/test procedures
- Add .gitignore file appropriate for the chosen technology stack

### File Organization
- Keep documentation in the root level or docs/ directory
- Place source code in src/ or appropriate language-specific directories
- Configuration files should be in the root level
- Build outputs should be in build/, dist/, or similar directories (and added to .gitignore)

## Validation Scenarios

### Current Repository State
To validate the current repository state:
1. Run `ls -la` - should show README.md and .git directory only
2. Run `cat README.md` - should show "# lmars111-creator-hub"
3. Run `git status` - should show clean working directory or your current changes
4. Run `git remote -v` - should show origin pointing to lmars111/lmars111-creator-hub

### Future Development
When code is added, update these instructions to include:
- Exact build commands with timing expectations
- Test execution procedures with "NEVER CANCEL" warnings for long-running tests
- Development server startup instructions
- Linting and formatting commands
- CI/CD validation steps

## Common Tasks

The following are outputs from frequently run commands in the current state:

### Repository Root
```
ls -la
total 16
drwxr-xr-x 3 runner docker 4096 [date] .
drwxr-xr-x 3 runner docker 4096 [date] ..
drwxr-xr-x 7 runner docker 4096 [date] .git
-rw-r--r-- 1 runner docker   22 [date] README.md
```

### README Content
```
cat README.md
# lmars111-creator-hub
```

### Git Status (Clean)
```
git status
On branch [current-branch]
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

## Technology Stack Planning

This repository is ready for development with any technology stack. Common setups include:

### For Node.js Development
- Add package.json: `npm init -y`
- Install dependencies: `npm install [packages]`
- Add build script: `npm run build`
- Add test script: `npm run test`
- Update instructions with specific timing and "NEVER CANCEL" warnings

### For Python Development
- Add requirements.txt or pyproject.toml
- Setup virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Add test runner configuration (pytest, unittest)
- Update instructions with specific timing and "NEVER CANCEL" warnings

### For Other Languages
- Add appropriate project files and build configuration
- Document build/test procedures with timing expectations
- Include "NEVER CANCEL" warnings for any commands taking >2 minutes
- Update validation scenarios for the specific technology

## Important Notes

- **No long-running commands exist currently** - all operations complete in seconds
- **Repository is in foundation state** - expect significant changes as development begins
- **Always update these instructions** when adding build systems, tests, or development tools
- **Future build commands may take 30+ minutes** - always include appropriate timeout warnings when adding them
- **NEVER CANCEL** warnings will become critical once build systems are added

- Repository type: Empty/Foundation repository
- Primary file: README.md only
- Build time: N/A (no build system)
